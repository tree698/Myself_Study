  <p>If you want to improve and upgrade your classes, chances are that what you need can be done with magic methods. Dunders in Python provide a wide range of functionalities, from type conversion to attribute managing. In this topic, we'll focus on "mathematical" magic methods: the ones that deal with arithmetics and comparisons.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Arithmetic operations</h2> 
  <p>There is a group of magic methods representing common arithmetic operations:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><code class="language-python">__add__()</code> : addition (+)</li> 
   <li><code class="language-python">__sub__()</code> : subtraction (-)</li> 
   <li><code class="language-python">__mul__()</code> : multiplication (*)</li> 
   <li><code class="language-python">__truediv__()</code> : division (/)</li> 
   <li><code class="language-python">__pow__()</code> : exponents (**)</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>This list is not exhaustive, there are many other methods, but these are the most common ones.</p> 
  <p>However, the question is when would we need to use them? Let's consider an example.</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">class ComplexNumber:
    def __init__(self, real_part, im_part):
        self.real_part = real_part
        self.im_part = im_part</code></pre> 
  <p>This is a class that represents <strong>complex numbers</strong>. A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/complex-numbers.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">complex number</a> is a number that can be expressed as <span class="math-tex">\(a + bi\)</span> where <span class="math-tex">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(b\)</span> are real numbers and <span class="math-tex">\(i\)</span> is the imaginary number: the solution of the equation <span class="math-tex">\(x^2 = -1\)</span> . So <span class="math-tex">\(a\)</span> is the real part of the complex number and <span class="math-tex">\(b\)</span> is the imaginary one. Just like ordinary numbers, we can add two complex numbers, multiply them, do subtraction and division and many other standard operations. Let's create two complex numbers and try to add and multiply them:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">z1 = ComplexNumber(1, 1)
z2 = ComplexNumber(-1, 2)

z3 = z1 + z2
# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'ComplexNumber' and 'ComplexNumber'
z4 = z1 * z2
# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'ComplexNumber' and 'ComplexNumber'</code></pre> 
  <p>As you can see, we cannot simply add two complex numbers using the standard operators in Python. We could, of course, define custom methods like <code class="language-python">add</code> or <code class="language-python">multiply</code> and call them when we need to do math with complex numbers, but it wouldn't be too convenient. A more elegant solution to this problem is to define magic methods <code class="language-python">__add__</code> and <code class="language-python">__mul__</code> in our <code class="language-python">ComplexNumber</code> class and then simply use standard operators with our complex numbers. Here's how it would look:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">class ComplexNumber:
    def __init__(self, real_part, im_part):
        self.real_part = real_part
        self.im_part = im_part

    def __add__(self, other):
        """Addition of complex numbers."""
        real = self.real_part + other.real_part
        imaginary = self.im_part + other.im_part
        return ComplexNumber(real, imaginary)

    def __mul__(self, other):
        """Multiplication of complex numbers."""
        real = (self.real_part * other.real_part - 
                self.im_part * other.im_part)
        imaginary = (self.real_part * other.im_part + 
                     other.real_part * self.im_part)
        return ComplexNumber(real, imaginary)</code></pre> 
  <p>First, let's go over the details of the methods. Since both addition and multiplication operators are binary, the methods take two arguments, <code class="language-python">self</code> and <code class="language-python">other</code>. <code class="language-python">other</code> is a name typically used to denote another object of the same class. These parameters represent the operands of these operations and in this case, <code class="language-python">self</code> is the left operand and <code class="language-python">other</code> is the right one. If the operator was unary, the method would only take <code class="language-python">self</code> as a parameter. </p> 
  <p>Both methods also calculate the real and the imaginary part of a new complex number and then return a new <code class="language-python">ComplexNumber</code> object as their results.</p> 
  <p>If we try to calculate the sum and the product of our complex numbers now, we won't get any errors:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">z3 = z1 + z2
print(z3.real_part, z3.im_part)  # 0 3

z4 = z1 * z2
print(z4.real_part, z4.im_part)  # -3 1</code></pre> 
  <p>If we wanted to define other operations, for instance, subtraction or division, we would do it similarly. The main principle with these methods is to understand what particular operation means for your object and then define the corresponding method. </p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Augmented assignment</h2> 
  <p>Python also has a number of methods for augmented assignment: a combination of standard arithmetic operations with the assignment. Their names are pretty self-explanatory so you can probably guess what operations they stand for:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><code class="language-python">__iadd__()</code>;</li> 
   <li><code class="language-python">__isub__()</code>;</li> 
   <li><code class="language-python">__imul__()</code>;</li> 
   <li><code class="language-python">__itruediv__()</code>;</li> 
   <li><code class="language-python">__ipow__()</code>;</li> 
   <li>and others...</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>For our complex numbers, let's define the method for += operator:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">class ComplexNumber:
    def __init__(self, real_part, im_part):
        self.real_part = real_part
        self.im_part = im_part

    # other magic methods we've already defined

    def __iadd__(self, other):
        """Addition with assignment (+=) for complex numbers."""
        self.real_part += other.real_part
        self.im_part += other.im_part
        return self</code></pre> 
  <p>This is how it works:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">z1 = ComplexNumber(8, -3)
z2 = ComplexNumber(-6, 2)

z1 += z2
print(z1.real_part, z1.im_part)  # 2 -1</code></pre> 
  <p></p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
   All magic methods for augmented assignment should return an instance of the class (
   <code class="language-python">self</code>) so that the assignment works correctly.
  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Comparison operators</h2> 
  <p>Another thing we might want to do with our objects is to compare them. Here are the magic methods that define the behavior of the comparison operators:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><code class="language-python">__eq__()</code> : equality (==)</li> 
   <li><code class="language-python">__ne__()</code> : inequality (!=)</li> 
   <li><code class="language-python">__lt__()</code> : less than (&lt;)</li> 
   <li><code class="language-python">__gt__()</code> : greater than (&gt;)</li> 
   <li><code class="language-python">__le__()</code> : less or equal (&lt;=)</li> 
   <li><code class="language-python">__ge__()</code> : greater or equal (&gt;=)</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Let's again take our class of complex numbers. Let's create 3 complex numbers and try to compare them.</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">z1 = ComplexNumber(5, -5)
z2 = ComplexNumber(5, -5)
z3 = ComplexNumber(4, 4)

print(z1 == z2)  # False
print(z1 == z3)  # False</code></pre> 
  <p>Two complex numbers are considered equal if and only if their real parts and imaginary parts are respectively equal. But, as we can see above, this is not how it worked in our program. This is because all numbers are different objects: the code checks them for identity, not equality, and since they have different id numbers, they are not considered the same. </p> 
  <p>We need to define the <code class="language-python">__eq__</code> method so that our comparisons run smoothly:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">class ComplexNumber:
    def __init__(self, real_part, im_part):
        self.real_part = real_part
        self.im_part = im_part

    def __eq__(self, other):
        """Compare two complex numbers for equality (==)."""
        return ((self.real_part == other.real_part) and
               (self.im_part == other.im_part))</code></pre> 
  <p>Now if we try to compare our two numbers we will get the correct result:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">print(z1 == z2)  # True
print(z1 == z3)  # False</code></pre> 
  <p>Other comparison operators can be defined in a similar way.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Summary</h2> 
  <p>In this topic, we've covered dunders that are useful when you want to introduce a little bit of math in your classes. A big advantage of magic methods is that you don't have to define them if you don't need it. But if you do, they're there to make your life easier!</p>
